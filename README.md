# Privacy Policy

Extension Privacy Policy
Intro
Different extensions use personal data in different ways. This privacy policy encompasses general principles of how extensions I create collect and handle personal data. Individual extensions, when you first use them, will display their own unique privacy policies and ask you to agree to them before continued use.

Data Collection
None of the extensions I write collect any data at all. Since no data is collected, it stands to reason, and is, indeed, the case, that none of your data can be sold to third parties.

That being said, there are a few other ways your data is used.

Chrome Storage API
Several of my extensions take advantage of Google Chrome's Storage API to locally store minimal state information. This is similar to a cookie. The only data that is stored in local storage is what you input into the input fields. Google syncs this information across your various computers and Chrome installations. However, my extensions only access this data locally on your machine and they do not transmit it.

Third-Party APIs
This extension communicates with the slack API and delivers the data that you send to slack. Be sure everything in inputs is appropriate to be seen by the entire slack channel. 

Feedback
If you have questions or concerns about this privacy policy, feel free to send me an [michaeltagg0\@gmail.com](mailto:michaeltagg0@gmail.com) or file an issue to this repository.
